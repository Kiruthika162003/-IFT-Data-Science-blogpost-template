### The Questions
1. In your blog post, include a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using `head(10)`). You can just include a screenshot rather than fighting to get the tables neatly formatted in HTML/markdown.

2. You’ll notice that the “strength” field (i.e. even, power play, short handed) only exists for goals, not shots. Furthermore, it doesn’t include the actual strength of players on the ice (i.e. 5 on 4, or 5 on 3, etc). Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available. You don’t need to implement this for this milestone. 

3. In a few sentences, discuss at least 3 additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset. We’re not looking for any particular answers, but if you need some inspiration, could a shot or goal be classified as a rebound/shot off the rush (explain how you’d determine these!) ?

### A small snippet of our final dataframe

The following table provides a detailed log of events from a specific hockey game, including shots and goals.

### Potential to add actual strength information to both shots and goals
For every shot or goal, start with two counters, one for each team, and set them both to 5. Look at the time of the shot or goal and find the earliest event in the past that happened more than 5 minutes before it. Then, check if there were any penalties in those 5 minutes. If there was a minor penalty and it happened within 2 minutes of the shot or goal, find out which team was penalized and subtract 1 from their counter. If there was a major penalty, find out which team was penalised and subtract 1 from their counter. Finally, make a new feature called "strength" for each shot or goal that shows the values of both counters, with the counter for the team that is shooting first and the counter for the team that is defending second.

### 3 Potential additional features - Discussion

**Shot Distance from Goal (shot_distance)**

Calculates the Euclidean distance of each shot from the goal.

**Time Between Shots (time_between_shots)**

Calculates the time elapsed since the previous shot, providing context on the game's pace.

**Odd-Man Rush Indicator (odd_man_rush)**

Marks whether a shot was part of an odd-man rush, indicating an advantageous attacking situation.
