### The Questions
1. Export the 4 plot offensive zone plots to HTML, and embed it into your blog post. Your plot must allow users to select any team during the selected season. 

2. Discuss (in a few sentences) what you can interpret from these plots.

3. Consider the Colorado Avalanche; take a look at their shot map during the 2016-17 season. Discuss what you could say about the team during this season. Now look at the shot map for the Colorado Avalanche for the 2020-21 season, and discuss what you could conclude from these differences. Does this make sense?

4. Consider the Buffalo Sabres, which have been a team that has struggled over recent years, and compare them to the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team which has won the Stanley for two years in a row. Look at the shot maps for these two teams from the 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons. Discuss what observations you can make. Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles? How complete of a picture do you think this paints?
