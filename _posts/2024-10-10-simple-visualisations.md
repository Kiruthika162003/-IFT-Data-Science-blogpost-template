### The Questions

1. Question 1
    * (a) Produce a figure comparing the shot types over all teams (i.e. just aggregate all of the shots), in a season of your choosing. 
    * (b) Overlay the number of goals overtop the number of shots. 

        (i) What appears to be the most dangerous type of shot? 

        (ii) The most common type of shot? 

        (iii) Why did you choose this figure? Add this figure and discussion to your blog post.
        
2. Question 2
    * (a) What is the relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal? 
    * (b)

        (i) Produce a figure for each season between 2018-19 to 2020-21 to answer this, and add it to your blog post along with a couple of sentences describing your figure. 

        (ii) Has there been much change over the past three seasons? 

        (iii) Why did you choose this figure?

3. Combine the information from the previous sections to produce a figure that shows the goal percentage (# goals / # shots) as a function of both distance from the net, and the category of shot types (you can pick a single season of your choice). Briefly discuss your findings; e.g. what might be the most dangerous types of shots?

### Shot types comparison over all teams in Season 2016-2017


![Shot Types Comparison](images\shot_compare.png)


For the 2016-2017 season, despite the wrist shot being the most **common** (frequent), the most **dangerous** shot type would depend on the conversion efficiency (goals/shots). Cradle shots have the highest conversion rate, at 0.24. This means about 24% of cradle shots result in goals, making it the most effective shot type in terms of goal-scoring efficiency.

### Choice of figure

The stacked bar chart shows both shots (in blue) and goals (in yellow) together for each shot type, providing a clear comparison between total attempts and successful conversions (goals). By stacking, the chart illustrates how a shot type contributes to total shots, while also highlighting how much of that total results in goals.

The small, yellow portion of each bar (relative to the blue portion) immediately helps visualize the efficiency of each shot type without needing complex calculations. The conversion rate labels (above each bar) provide a direct numeric measure of efficiency, showing the percentage of shots that result in goals. This saves the viewer from having to calculate it manually.

By showing multiple shot types on the same axis, it's easy to compare which shots are most common (e.g., wrist shots have the highest count) and which shots have the highest goal conversion (e.g., cradle, bat, and between-the-legs shots have higher efficiency). This allows the viewer to assess both volume (how often a shot type is taken) and effectiveness (goal efficiency) in one figure. The figure is not only a simple count of events but also conveys an important metric—goal-scoring efficiency—which is critical for understanding the relative value of each shot type.
Viewers can quickly see not just how often each type of shot is taken but also how often it results in a goal, a more meaningful metric in sports analytics.

The conversion rates placed above each bar give immediate insight into efficiency without overcrowding the figure. This avoids the need for a separate efficiency plot and integrates all necessary data in a single view. The layout of shot types on the x-axis makes it easy to see and compare the different types side by side.

Moreover, the color difference (blue for shots and yellow for goals) makes it easy to distinguish between attempts and successes, providing a clear visual contrast that aids interpretation.
